# McLib
The common library for McNugget scripts

## Usage for Development
To add this library to your project, use this command:
```sh
uv add --path <relative path to mclib/>
```
Example:
```sh
uv add --path ../mclib
```
You should use *relative paths* and **not** from your home directory (like `~/Projects/mcnugget/mclib`) because that would be ***incompatible*** on other people's computers!

Feel free to add any of your own library files here as well as you need for your project!
