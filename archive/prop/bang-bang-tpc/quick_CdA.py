# Trevor's quick CdA calculator
#   Requires the following:
#   - Total pressure
#   - Temperature
#   - Flowrate in SCFM
#   Outputs:
#   - The CdA of your system's choke point (assuming that your measurements are upstream of it)
#   Problems for the future:
#   - Make it work with arrays of data (Only have single calc rn because flowmeter data wasn't timestamped and I figured working with max and min values would suffice)
