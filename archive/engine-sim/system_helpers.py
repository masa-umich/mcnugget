    Return the outlet pressure of the dome regulator given a mass flow and inlet pressure.
    These explicit functions are data interpolations from our regulator manufacturer Premier,
    which gave several inlet pressure curves (ksi) as a function of SCFM and outlet [psig].
    Args:
        inlet_p: Inlet pressure [Pa]
        mdot: Mass flow requirement [kg/s]
    Returns:
        float: Outlet pressure [Pa]
    General form of our function: a*tan(-x/b)+475
    The coefficient a has a range of [5,35] (linear relation with inlet pressure)
    The coefficient b has a range of [750, 1310] (exponential relation with inlet pressure)
    Example: 35*tan(-x/750)+475 is for the 1 ksi inlet pressure
    Example: 25*tan(-x/830)+475 is for the 1.5 ksi inlet pressure
    To model the seat-load drop, use (200/(x+6))+470 for SCFM < 50
    Note: Given 4.5 ksi and room temp, max choked mdot of a 1" ID pipe is ~36 kg/s, and 
    500 psi + 1" ID is ~4 kg/s (7200 SCFM). Thus, we will lose control of the dome regulator
    far before pipe choking becomes an issue, i.e. 850 SCFM (0.467 kg/s) is the upper limit.
    """
    # As the reg increases its flow area, the demand for mass flow to bring the exit pressure
    # increases at a faster rate than it can increase the flow area. So eventually the 
    # pressure ratio keeps increasing (even as mdot increases) until it reaches the critical
    # pressure ratio, at which it chokes and we have achieved the max mdot of the system.
    # This is where we switch to a choked flow model of the system until the COPV pressure
    # is basically the ullage pressure, after which we can switch to a blowdown model.
    # Additionally, the reason we can just plug in our dome reg curve into the system of
    # equations is because the "tendancy" to go towards the set pressure of ~500 psi is built
    # into the curve itself; initially the ullage is at 500 psi anyway, and as we only lower
    # ullage pressure marginally (e.g. to 490 psi), we get very low SCFM needed to try 
    # getting back to 500 psi, even though the actual downstream pressure is lower than set.
    # Google "swagelok" and "pressure droop" and "lockup" to learn more about reg curves.
