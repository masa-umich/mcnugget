Installing REFPROP and using the Python wrapper is a pain, but here's how you do it:
(I'll paste this in the Wiki eventually but for now this is easy-access)

1. Go to Logan's pinned Slack message in #fluids for how to install the underlying REFPROP application.
    a. If you can't find it, just download REFPROP from the MASA Drive here: 
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_tEtZ_Gl1OS7ehs69Y-mGAcqrUk23Lx/view?usp=drive_link
2. (Assuming you're on Windows using WSL, since this is how I got it to work) Download and run the .exe
    per the previous step. It should install REFPROP in Program Files (x86).
3. Run the program to make sure it works. 
4. Now that the application runs, we need to install/use the Python wrapper. Follow the instructions here:
    https://github.com/usnistgov/REFPROP-cmake
5. Step 2 in confusing but basically paste the FORTRAN folder from your REFPROP install (inside Program Files (x86)) 
    into the root of the repository you just cloned. Then follow the rest of the steps.
6. Once it's done building, now paste the FLUIDS and MIXTURES folders (inside Program Files (x86)) into your new 
    build (in the repo, paste into REFPROP-cmake/build/). 
7. Done! Try running ./test_refprop.py in this folder to verify that it works properly.

NOTE: The REFPROP usage syntax is really confusing and online documentation sucks, but I've uploaded an Excel
spreadsheet (REFPROP.xlsx) that should walk you through what all of the arguments mean. Refer here too:
