### OVERVIEW ###

This autosequence pressurizes the PRESS_TANKS using regular 2K and Gooster

Once you run this autosequence, you will be prompted to specify the type of test:
- HOTFIRE
    - Connects to synnax.masa.engin.umich.edu
    - Uses the Press Delay intended for Hot Fire

- COLDFLOW
    - Connects to synnax.masa.engin.umich.edu
    - Uses the Press Delay intended for Cold Flow

- SIM
    - Connects to localhost
    - Uses a shorter Press Delay to keep sims running fast 

After initializing the client and reference variables, the autosequence will:

1. Set Starting State
    - Energize all normally_open
    - De-energize all normally_closed
    
2. PHASE 1: 2k Bottle Equalization
    - Open and close press_fill to raise psi at target rate
    - Stop when 2K bottle and Press Tanks are within 80 psi of each other
    - Leave press_fill open
    - WAIT for confirmation

3. PHASE 2: Pressurization with Gas Booster
    - Open gooster_fill
    - Open air_drive_iso_1
    - Open and close air_drive_iso_2 to raise psi at target rate
    - Stop when Press Tanks reach press_target psi
        - if it takes more then Press Delay time to pressurize, will prompt user to continue or end
    - Close air_drive_iso_1 and air_drive_iso_2
    - Close gooster_fill
    - Close press_fill
