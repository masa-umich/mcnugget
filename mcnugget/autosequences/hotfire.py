### OVERVIEW ###

This autosequence combines the processes of pre_press.py and reg_fire.py.

When pre_press is true:
    1. Set starting state
        - Energize all normally_open
        - De-energize all normally_closed

    2. Confirm tank pressures are nominal
        - use FUEL_PRE_PRESS to pressurize the FUEL tank to TARGET_1 if necessary
        - use OX_PRE_PRESS to pressurize the OX tank to TARGET_2 if necessary
        - continue once both tank pressures are nominal

    3. Open Valves
        - The following need to be opened at the same time:
            - FUEl_PREVALVE
            - OX_PREVALVE
            - FUEL_PRESS_ISO
            - OX_PRESS_ISO
            - OX_DOME_ISO
        - We will then wait for 25 seconds, barring an abort

    4. Close Valves
        - Close all the valves opened in step 3
        - Open FUEL_VENT and OX_LOW_FLOW_VENT and PRESS_VENT

    X. Abort
        - The only conditions which will trigger an abort:
            - 2/3 PTs reading above maximum pressure for OX_TANK or FUEL_TANK
            - Manual ctrl-c

When reg_fire is true:
    1. Set starting state
    - Energize all normally_open
    - De-energize all normally_closed

2. Confirm tank pressures are nominal
    - use FUEL_PRE_PRESS to pressurize the FUEL tank to TARGET_1 if necessary
    - use OX_PRE_PRESS to pressurize the OX tank to TARGET_2 if necessary
    - continue once both tank pressures are nominal

3. Open Valves
    - The following need to be opened at the same time:
        - FUEl_PREVALVE
        - OX_PREVALVE
        - FUEL_PRESS_ISO
        - OX_PRESS_ISO
        - OX_DOME_ISO
    - We will then wait for 25 seconds, barring an abort

4. Close Valves
    - Close all the valves opened in step 3
    - Open FUEL_VENT and OX_LOW_FLOW_VENT and PRESS_VENT

X. Abort
    - The only conditions which will trigger an abort:
        - 2/3 PTs reading above maximum pressure for OX_TANK or FUEL_TANK
        - Manual ctrl-c
