This is the prototype of the hotfire autosequence.
Currently, it does the following (edit if changed)
1. TODO: safes system
2. TODO: pressurizes accumulator press and L-stand
3. TODO: runs TPC to maintain L-stand pressure

- The TPC function opens/closes TESCOMS 1-4 automatically to maintain pressure
- It does this based on the pressure in the L-stand
    - Uses valve 1 to keep pressure between BOUND_1 and TARGET_1
    - Uses valve 2 to keep pressure between BOUND_2 and TARGET_2
    - same for 3 and 4

If you ABORT this script (by pressing ctrl-c while it is running), it will
    - TODO: impelment this
    - close accumulator valve
    - close all tescoms
    - open MPV
    - open MPV vent
