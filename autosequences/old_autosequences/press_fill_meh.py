### OVERVIEW ###

This autosequence pressurizes the PRESS_TANKS using regular 2K and Gooster

- We have two different prompts to run (simulation or actual test).
    - The big difference with the simulation is that the time.sleep() functions have a shorter wait time (divided by 60)
    - The simulation and the actual test will connect to the localhost and the MASA cluster, respectively.

The following steps outline what happens during the actual test, not the simulation. 

1. Set Starting State
    - Energize all normally_open
    - De-energize all normally_closed

2. PHASE 1: 2k Bottle Equalization
    - Open and close press_fill to raise psi at target rate
    - Stop when 2K bottle and Press Tanks are within 80 psi of each other
    - Leave press_fill open
    - WAIT for confirmation

3. PHASE 2: Pressurization with Gas Booster
    - Open gooster_fill
    - Open air_drive_iso_1
    - Open and close air_drive_iso_2 to raise psi at target rate
    - Stop when Press Tanks reach PRESS_TARGET psi or cannot reach increment over 60 seconds
    - Close air_drive_iso_1 and air_drive_iso_2
    - Close gooster_fill
    - Close press_fill
